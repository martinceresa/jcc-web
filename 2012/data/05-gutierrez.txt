Abstract: Software development is facing a big challenge, the free lunch
is over and our tools not longer apply to the scale shift we are seeing
nowadays. There's a need for new tools on the fields of concurrency and
distributed systems to scale up and out beyond what threads and locks
can provide us. Program source code can easily reach a million lines of
code and large collaboration teams. When they grow in size, types don't
easily fall into "is-a" hierarchies.

We're presenting Go, a programming language designed for dealing with
concurrency problems and well suited for systems programming. Created
at Google by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike as a replacement for C++, Go has
being developed in an open source model since it's beginning, supported
by a large active community. In this talk, we'll walk through the
language basics, concurrency patterns and design examples.
