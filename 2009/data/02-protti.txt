Abstract: In JCC 2008 we have written both a virtual machine launcher
and a small, dummy kernel to run inside it. This approach serves to
learn about low level programming and processor manipulation. However,
the end result is not a real OS kernel suitable to boot on a real PC,
but it only works inside the virtual machine created by us. This year,
we will develop a real OS kernel from scratch, following the guidelines
of the Carnegie Mellon 410 course on Operating Systems but with slight
modifications to avoid the need to use a Simics simulator. The end
result should be a real OS kernel image capable of booting our PC from
persistent media like i.e. a floppy disk or hard disk.
