ShortTitle: Finding scalable solution for a worldwide audience

Abstract: <p>Because of worldwide massive impact, Google engineers face
unique engineering problems every day. As a smart community, once they
find a solution to an oft-recurring challenge they build a tool as to
avoid reinventing the wheel every time. Tools are improved over time,
and extended in order to fit new cases, leading to a mighty tool shed. In
this talk I'll highlight some of these challenges and explain what our tools
do to solve it, giving you a glance of how we work in this
environment.</p>
